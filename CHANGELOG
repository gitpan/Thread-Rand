0.04    29 September 2002
	Use "load.pm" instead of AutoLoader.  Increased dependency on
	Thread::Tie to 0.08 in Makefile.PL.

	Removed "our" from $VERSION, should shave off some bytes in
	memory usage, as found from testing with Benchmark::Thread::Size.

0.03	6 September 2002
	Added alternate solution to the documentation to circumvent the rand()
	problem with threads.  Suggested by Benjamin Goldberg.

0.02	5 September 2002
	Added class method "global" to hijack the rand() and srand() functions
	globally.  This to circumvent the bug in rand() and threads I found
	today.  Added documentation and test-suite for this.

	Added support for AutoLoader.

	2 September 2002
	Fixed tiny nit/optimization in sub and().

0.01	1 September 2002
	First version of Thread::Rand.
